## POS Tagging
###		12-1 An Intro to Parts of Speech and POS Tagging
The concepts of parts of speech->noun, verb, adv, prep, conj, pron...
particles: off, up
open class (lexical)words + closed classes

**POS**: part of speech
    The problem of ambiguity in POS Tagging: regexps, text-to-speech

### 12-2 Some Methods and Results on Sequence Models for POS Tagging
What are the main sources of information for POS tagging? Generally, we think that 
the neighbour words are, but in fact, it isnâ€™t.
		Continuing above, it can be suprisingly well if we check it the word in its own.
		POS Tagging Accuracies:Trigram 
Trigram HMM -95% / -55%
		Maxent P(t|w): 93.7% / 82.6%
	Using words only in a straight classifier works as well as a basic sequence model(HMM), which is out of expectation.
